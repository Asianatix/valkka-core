Welcome to your new build!

Congratulations, you succesfully created this directory, using the "new_build.bash" command.

Start by editing "run_cmake.bash" in order to get a characteristic build, say, debug, verbose, production, etc.

When you're ready, run

./run_cmake.bash

After that, you can do 

make

or 

make VERBOSE=1

If you want to see what's going on.  

To build either the library or just tests, try:

make Valkka
make tests

When running tests, first set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH with

source test_env.bash

To set up your test streams, edit "set_test_streams.bash" and do

source set_test_streams.bash

After that, you can run tests in the "bin/" directory

To check out the dependencies of your shared library, type

./checkdep.py

.. you can use the output in the main "CMakeLists.txt" file to inform the debian package about dependencies

And if you want to do packages (for a production version), simply run

make package
